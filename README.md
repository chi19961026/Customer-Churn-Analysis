# Customer Churn Analysis, Clustering, and Prediction Model Development

## Project Overview
This project aims to reduce customer churn and increase revenue through a comprehensive data analysis process, machine learning models, and actionable recommendations. 

### The project involves:
* Customer Churn Analysis: Uncovering insights about churn rates and reasons.
* Customer Segmentation: Using K-means clustering to segment customers.
* Churn Prediction Model: Developing a model to predict churn with a 77% recall rate.
* Actionable Recommendations: Providing tailored short-term and long-term strategies.
* Financial Forecasting: Estimating potential revenue gains from churn prevention.

### Key Insights
* Short-term contracts and fiber optic internet users have higher churn rates.
* Monthly contract customers with fewer add-on services churn more.
* Competition and service quality dissatisfaction are the main reasons for churn.

## Data Analysis and Modeling 

### Churn Analysis:
* Total churn rate: 26.54%
* High churn in short-term contracts and fiber optic internet users.

### Customer Segmentation (K-means Clustering):
* 4 clusters identified based on tenure, add-on services, and internet type.
* Clusters 1 and 4 are high-revenue contributors with distinct characteristics.

### Churn Prediction Model:
* 76% overall accuracy, 77% recall rate.
* Prioritizes identifying at-risk customers.

### Recommendations
Short-term:
* Implement ML prediction model for personalized retention strategies.
* Conduct A/B testing to refine strategies.

Long-term:
* Improve service quality and customer satisfaction.
* Integrate churn prevention strategies into marketing automation.
* Develop a dashboard for real-time performance monitoring.

## Financial Forecasting
Potential to increase monthly revenue by 4% to 8% and Customer Lifetime Value by 4% to 12%.
